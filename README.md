# Drug-Target Affine Prediction using Graph Neural Networks

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning approach for predicting drug-target interactions (DTI) using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The model combines different GNN architectures including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to learn the complex relationships between drugs and proteins.

## Features
- Multiple GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GIN)
- Support for both drug and protein graph data
- Integration of 3D protein structure information
- SMILES to graph conversion for drug molecules


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- PyTorch Geometric
- RDKit
- NetworkX
- NumPy
- Pandas



## Data
The project uses two benchmark datasets:
- DAVIS: Contains kinase inhibitors and their binding affinities
- KIBA: Contains kinase inhibitors and their binding affinities
